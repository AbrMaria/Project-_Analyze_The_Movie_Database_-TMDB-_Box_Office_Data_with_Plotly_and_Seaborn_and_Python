# Project_Analyze_The_Movie_Database_TMDB_Box_Office_Data_with_Plotly_and_Seaborn_and_Python
Use Plotly Python and Seaborn during exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering and data visualizations
 
Task 1: Analyzing Movie Release Dates
- exploratory data analysis.

Task 2: Preprocessing Features
- perform data imputation to account for missing values,
- standardized the date format

Task 3: Create Features Based on Release Date
- define a function to create new columns for the year, weekday, month, week of the year, day, and quarter.

Task 4: Using Plotly to Visualize the Number of Films Per Year
- create an interactive visualization of the number of films released per year in both the training and test sets.
- use the generic go.Scatter function from plotly.graph_objects, and specify the mode argument to choose between markers or lines.

Task 5: Number of Films and Revenue Per Year
- visualize both the number of films and total revenue per year, and the number of films vs the average revenue per year.

Task 6: Do Release Days Impact Revenue?
- creating a categorical plot of the day of the week on the x-axis and revenue on the y-axis.

Task 7: Relationship between Runtime and Revenue
- creating a plot that describes the distribution of the duration of films. 
- creating a plot that describes revenue against duration and find the data illustrates the optimal duration of a movie to maximize revenue.
